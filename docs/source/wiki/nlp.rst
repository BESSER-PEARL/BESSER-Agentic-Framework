NLP
===

BBF bots are powered by NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools that provide them with the necessary
capabilities to understand and generate human language.

- **Intent Classification** to recognize the user intentions, implicit in messages.
- **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) to identify entities within the user messages.
- **Speech-to-text** to transcribe audio messages, allowing the users to use their voice to interact with the bots.
