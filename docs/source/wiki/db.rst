Database
========

The bots can use databases in order to read or write data. BBF allows the easy connection with external databases,
thanks to the wide variety of Python libraries available, such as `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_.

BBF provides a :doc:`monitoring database <db/monitoring_db>` that can be used to monitor the bot usage.
