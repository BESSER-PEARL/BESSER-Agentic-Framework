Version 5.0.0
=============

Agent2Agent protocol is here as a platform!
-------------------------------------------

Using the standarized :doc:`Agent2Agent <../wiki/platforms/a2a_platform>` protocol, your agents developed with BESSER-Agentic-Framework can now interact with agents developed with other Agent Development Kits (e.g., Microsoft Agentic Framework). Multi-agent-collaboration irrespective of the platform using which they are developed can save your precious time. Try it out!

New Features
------------

- Register an agent through :class:`~besser.agent.platforms.a2a.agent_registry.AgentRegistry` in the platform
- Exposing agents that are present and their respective agent-card through different host endpoints
- Submitting a job as a task to the agent
- Support for HTTP polling to know the status of a task 
- Live task updates through SSE :meth:`besser.agent.platforms.a2a.server.sse_event_handler` (no need to reload the page to know the status)

Changes
-------

- Registered a new platform for agent to communicate through Agent2Agent protocol :meth:`besser.agent.core.agent.use_a2a_platform`
