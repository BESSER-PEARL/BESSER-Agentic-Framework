Version 3.0.0
=============

New Features
------------

- Added the :class:`~besser.agent.core.transition.event.Event` and :class:`~besser.agent.core.transition.condition.Condition` classes.
  Now, transitions can be triggered by incoming events and/or conditions (see :doc:`../wiki/core/transitions` and :doc:`../wiki/core/events` docs)
- New transition syntax with :class:`~besser.agent.core.transition.transition_builder.TransitionBuilder` class

Improvements
------------

- For each session, transitions from the current state are periodically evaluated for satisfiability (every N seconds, N being configurable with :class:`~besser.agent.CHECK_TRANSITIONS_DELAY` property)
    - Transitions also evaluated immediately after receiving an event or finishing the execution of a state.
- All built-in transitions (intent matching, file reception, session variables) have been refactored to follow the new event/condition and TransitionBuilder mechanisms.
- Monitoring DB has been updated to store received events
