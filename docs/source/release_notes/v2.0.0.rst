Version 2.0.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Refactor project name to BESSER Agentic Framework

New Features
------------

- Multi-agent systems: communication between agents. An agent can send a payload to another agent
- Added logger class, used to print log messages

Improvements
------------

- Dependencies have been split into multiple requirements files allowing for the installation of more lightweight environments.

  - requirements-core.txt: mandatory dependencies, necessary for the framework to work
  - requirements-extras.txt: extra dependencies necessary for optional services (e.g., RAG, Speech-to-text)
  - requirements-llms.txt: necessary to use LLMs
  - requirements-tensorflow.txt: Necessary for the SimpleIntentClassifier. Since tensorflow is a very heavy package, this allows to install it only if necessary
  - requirements-torch.txt: To install pytorch (necessary for some HuggingFace models)
  - requirements-docs.txt: dependencies to compile the project documentation

- Added setup.py to define the classes to install the optional dependencies, homonymous to the new requirements files and including a class "all" that installs all the dependencies at once.
