BBF has been created to reduce boilerplate code, complex API understanding, and technical details
to facilitate the definition and deployment of your agents. BBF helps you focus on what really matters: the
conversation logic you want to embed in your agent. Moreover, it is **pure Python**, so you can easily integrate any
Python library in your agents and vice versa.
