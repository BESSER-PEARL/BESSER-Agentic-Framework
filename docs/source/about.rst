About
=====

The BESSER bot-framework has been created to reduce boilerplate code, complex API understanding, and technical details
to facilitate the definition and deployment of your bots. Bot Framework helps you focus on what really matters: the
conversation logic you want to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, it is **pure Python**, so you can easily integrate any
Python library in your chatbots and vice versa.
